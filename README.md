2nd First Friday
----------------

I went through the tutorials for OpenCV + Python.

http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html

My main objective was getting image tracking working.  See videocapture.py.

```
brew install opencv
virtualenv tracking
cd tracking
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
